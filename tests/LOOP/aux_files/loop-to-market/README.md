loop-to-store
=============

Scripts to pack, copy and publish the latest loop client to the store automatically.

Requirements:

  * You have the loop client repository (https://github.com/mozilla-b2g/firefoxos-loop-client)
    cloned *AND* updated. I'm not going to run git pull for you, sorry.
  * zip, unzip, scp, ssh and curl are all on the path. And they
    work. Which should go without saying, but you would be surprised. Or not.
  * You have uploaded manually the app at least once to get an UUID
  * You have read config.template and created an adequate .config file
